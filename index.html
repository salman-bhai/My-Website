<p>This is my blog which talks about my life experiences and also how initially struggled and came up to grips with dealing with problems that weren't something which I was expecting to come up with.
The blog has been running and I've constructed about three articles and more are expected to come soon. Keep watching!</p>

<p>This is my technical blog where I keep on talking about my projects and how much progress I've made in them as well as talk about recent developments in the field of Computer Science which I've come across and have read about.
The blog is still under construction but keep watching this space. The link will come out soon.</p>
