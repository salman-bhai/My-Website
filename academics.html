							<h4>About Me</h4></br>
							I am 19 years old (though I feel way older these days). I am mostly in front of my laptop the entire day either doing my projects or writing articles for my blogs.</br>
							I try to achieve as much as I can and make the maximum of my efforts. I like to learn different skills while browsing the internet! I love reading novels especially the fiction genre. But somehow as I grew older, I haven't been getting much time to read them!</br>
							I am a huge cricket fan! Even though I don't get to watch matches live these days, I still keep track of the score through mobile apps! My dream is to create a fully functional Artificially Intelligent (AI) personal assistant for myself as I am very careless and often misplace my stuff!
